# Taking user input in python

'''the default input function in python takes input as a string. If we want to take input as an integer, we can use the int() function to convert the string to an integer.
If we want to take input as a float, we can use the float() function to convert the string to a float.
If we want to take input as a list, we can use the split() function to convert the string to a list.'''
