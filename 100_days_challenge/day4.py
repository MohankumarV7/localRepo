 #REPL: Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop
 
#This is an interactive mode where we can write Python code and see the output immediately. If we need line by line execution, we can use the REPL mode.
#If we want a script to run, we can write the code in a file and run it using the command `python filename.py`.
